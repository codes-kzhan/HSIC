# HSIC

This is a very simple implementation of our paper:

Highly-Economized Multi-View Binary Compression for Scalable Image Clustering, 

The details can be found in the ECCV 2018 paper (release soon). 

This code has been evaluated on Matlab 2017a.

Resources:

We supply ImageNet-10 dataset, which has been nonlinearly projected onto a 1000-dim anchor feature space.
